# farkle
in search of an optimal farkle strategy, because I'm sick of losing to my little brother



# brain dump of notes
* parameters to tune
	+ I realize that some of these would be easy to solve for deterministically
	+ Threshold: above 500 ? ok thx bai
	+ Re-roll threshold: above threshold but have >= N dice, ok roll again
	+ optimism: 112245, keep 1? keep 11? keep 115?

* how to compare scores? mean? sd?
* what if I have a game of N players, how should your strategy change given you're winning / loosing????
	+ ok this seems kinda tough lamo
