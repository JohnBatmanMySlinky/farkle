# farkle
in search of an optimal farkle strategy, because I'm sick of losing to my little brother



# brain dump of notes
* score board
	+ 5 = 50, 1 = 100
	+ 111 = 1000
	+ 222, 333, 444, 555, 666 = 200, 300, 400, 500, 600
	+ 4 of a kind = 1000
	+ 5 of a kind = 2000
	+ 6 of a kind = 3000
	+ straight = 1500
	+ 3x2 = 1000
	+ 4x2 + 1x2 = 1500
	+ 2x3 = 2500
* 500 buy in
* parameters to tune
	+ I realize that some of these would be easy to solve for deterministically
	+ Threshold: above 500 ? ok thx bai
	+ Re-roll threshold: above threshold but have >= N dice, ok roll again
	+ optimism: 112245, keep 1? keep 11? keep 115?

* R or python or something new?

* how to compare scores? mean? sd?
* what if I have a game of N players, how should your strategy change given you're winning / loosing????
	+ ok this seems kinda tough lamo
